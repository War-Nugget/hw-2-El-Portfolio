# hw-2-El-Portfolio
By Sahil Patel

This assignment assigned to me by Georgia Tech coding bootcamp and has taught me how to properly write a website from scratch. It truley was a tough 30+ hours of trying to make every section look like a modern site and still has long ways to go. Overall, this project was very fun when talking to others while working on our own projects hearing our struggles and our feats. Not only has this assignment taught me how to write a portfolio website, I feel as though I can front-end other websites that I will work on in the future all thanks to the 3 hour video I learned on Bootstrap v.5. I will link all my references in the bottom of the read me.

## My website has all of the following:

### Navigation Bar
- The navigation bar I was used is shown on the left margin which smoothly scrolls to all sections of my portfolio.
- I decided giving the navigation bar an opac background seemed fit.
- The navigation bar is locked on the top left of the screen to maneuver freely through sections with the click of a button.

### About Me
- The about me section is not too special for only displays a quick bio of myself and my studies.

### My Works
- The My works section really put my knowledge of bootstrap to use.
- Adding column margins to the section proved difficult and required a bootstrap cheat sheet to find perfect margins that would display on any screen.
- Only one current project located in section for other projects are a work in progress.
- The project links itself to its respectful project.

### Contact
- Added a contact me form but doesnt entirley work at the moment. Only emails name and subject.
- Contact fits with any screen size.
- Second contact me section that displays email, linkedin, discord, and github.


### CSS
- Css was not too difficult thanks to bootstrap.
- truley only for root colors, fonts, and slight margins.
- (Will be cleaned up in the future)
